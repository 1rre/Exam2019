T1
=====================

- [x] : T1.1
- [x] : T1.2
- [x] : T1.3
- [x] : T1.4

May be worth restarting T1.3 and T1.4 as they are fairly convoluted at this point

T2
=====================

- [x] : T2.1 (passed test_network_io.cpp)
- [x] : T2.2 (100 random test cases)

T1
=====================

- [x] : T3.1
- [x] : T3.2
- [x] : T3.3
