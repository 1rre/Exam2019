 print_component_list.cpp appears to already have been implemented. (T1.2)
 in readme.html it is stated that '&<C<L<R<|', however an example of ordering primitives it states 'C0.5 < C1 < C2 < R1e-3 < R1 < L0.3 < L10'. I have assumed that L<R. (T1.3)
 No clear indication of which of (R1|R2|R3|R4) and (R1|R2|R3) is greater. I have assumed that in the case of |, the former is greater, however if we were to replace | with &, the latter would be greater.
